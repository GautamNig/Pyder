# Pyder
Magic of python and blender. Python + Blender = Pyder

Here is a Script to show some awesomness of blender when combined with python.

Create any object 'Sat2'(I created an object of shape of sateelite), which will revolve around in circles.
Place this object on a seperate Layer if you want to. This is the object which will be cloned by the script and made to follow 
circular paths depicting orbits. 

To watch the complete animation created using this script visit:

The video has some additional features like unhiding of satellites at particular keyframes, which is also done using some additional script, note: unhiding is not part of this script.
